# TeamSwim.Extensions
*(Still in Beta)*

Collection of practical .NET extension methods & classes to boost productivity.

- No outer dependencies
- JetBrains.Annotations support.
- No custom namespaces.
- Currently targeting framework(s):
	- .NET Core 3.1
	- .NET Standard 2.0

## Additional Notes
- All extensions methods are 100% unit tested.
- Certain extension methods are marked as being "opinionated" in the XML comments. They are useful but not completely holistic in practice. However, their intent should be clear by the name/documentation.
