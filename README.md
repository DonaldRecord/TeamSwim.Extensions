# TeamSwim.Extensions
*(Still in Beta)*

Growing collection of practical .NET extension methods, classes, and facades to boost productivity.

- No outer dependencies
- JetBrains.Annotations support.
- Uses Microsoft namespaces.
- Currently targeting framework(s):
	- .NET Core 3.1
	- .NET Standard 2.0
	- .NET Framework 5.0

## Additional Notes
- Code coverage is currently around 86%.
- Certain extension methods are marked as being "opinionated" in the XML comments. They are useful but not completely holistic in practice. However, their intent should be clear by the name/documentation.
