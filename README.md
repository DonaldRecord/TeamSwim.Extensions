# TeamSwim.Extensions

Growing collection of practical .NET extension methods, classes, and facades to boost productivity and provide additional functionality.

- No outer dependencies
- JetBrains.Annotations support.
- Uses Microsoft namespaces.
- Currently targeting framework(s):
	- .NET Core 3.1
	- .NET Standard 2.0
	- .NET Framework 5.0
	- .NET Framework 6.0
- Certain extension methods are marked as being "opinionated" in the XML comments. They are useful but not completely holistic in practice. However, their intent should be clear by the name/documentation.
